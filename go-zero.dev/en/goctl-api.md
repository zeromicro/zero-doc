goctl api is one of the core modules in goctl. It can quickly generate an api service through the .api file with one click. If you just start a go-zero api demo project,
You can complete an api service development and normal operation without even coding. In traditional api projects, we have to create directories at all levels, write structures,
Define routing, add logic files, this series of operations, if calculated according to the business requirements of a protocol, it takes about 5 to 6 minutes for the entire coding to actually enter the writing of business logic.
This does not consider the various errors that may occur during the writing process. With the increase of services and the increase of agreements, the time for this part of the preparation work will increase proportionally.
The goctl api can completely replace you to do this part of the work, no matter how many agreements you have, in the end, it only takes less than 10 seconds to complete.

> [!TIP]
> The structure is written, and the route definition is replaced by api, so in general, it saves you the time of creating folders, adding various files and resource dependencies.
