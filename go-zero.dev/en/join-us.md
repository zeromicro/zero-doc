## Issues
Our community will make every effort to actively provide feedback and support for problems encountered while using go-zero.
However, due to the large number of people in the community both asking and answering questions, we make no guarantees about the order in which questions will be answered.
Additionally, while our team is working on issues raised by the community, time constraints could cause some questions to go unanswered.
One way to mitigate this is to post all feedback, be it regarding new features or discovered bugs, as a github issue for easier tracking.
The go-zero team will also ensure that new features have their own issue created for easy reference by the community.
The issues page is also where you can keep track of the latest go-zero news.
We welcome everyone to actively participate in the issues page and community discussions.

### How to create a new issue
* Navigate to the [go-zero issues page](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/issues)
* Click `[New issue]` in the upper right corner
* Choose the issue category from `[Bug report]`, `[Feature request]`, or `[Question]`
* Fill in the issue title and content
* Click `[Submit new issue]`
