## goctl？
Many people will pronounce `goctl` as `go-C-T-L`. This is a wrong way of thinking. You should refer to `go control` and pronounce `ɡō kənˈtrōl`.

## View version information
```shell
$  goctl -v
```

If goctl is installed, it will output text information in the following format:

```text
goctl version ${version} ${os}/${arch}
```

For example output:
```text
goctl version 1.1.5 darwin/amd64
```

Version number description
* version: goctl version number
* os: Current operating system name
* arch: Current system architecture name

## Install goctl

### The way one（go get）

```shell
$ GO111MODULE=on GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn/,direct go get -u github.com/tal-tech/go-zero/tools/goctl
```

Use this command to install the goctl tool into the `GOPATHbin` directory

### The way two （fork and build）

Pull a source code from the go-zero code repository `git@github.com:tal-techgo-zero.git`, enter the `toolsgoctl` directory to compile the goctl file, and then add it to the environment variable.

After the installation is complete, execute `goctl -v`. If the version information is output, the installation is successful, for example:

```shell
$ goctl -v

goctl version 1.1.4 darwin/amd64
```
