## go-zero
go-zero is a web and rpc framework that with lots of engineering practices builtin. Itâ€™s born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design, and has been serving sites with tens of millions users for years.

## goctl
An auxiliary tool designed to improve engineering efficiency and reduce error rates for developers.

## goctl plugins
Refers to the peripheral binary resources centered on goctl, which can meet some personalized code generation requirements, such as the routing merge plug-in `goctl-go-compact` plug-in,
The `goctl-swagger` plugin for generating swagger documents, the `goctl-php` plugin for generating the php caller, etc.

## intellij/vscode plugins
A plug-in developed with goctl on the intellij series products, which replaces the goctl command line operation with the UI.

## api file
An api file refers to a text file used to define and describe an api service. It ends with the .api suffix and contains IDL of the api syntax.

## goctl environment
The goctl environment is the preparation environment before using goctl, including:
* golang environment
* protoc
* protoc-gen-go plugin
* go module | gopath

## go-zero-demo
Go-zero-demo contains a large repository of all the source code in the document. When we write the demo in the future, we all create sub-projects under this project.
Therefore, we need to create a large warehouse in advance `go-zero-demo`, and I put this warehouse in the home directory here.

```shell
$ cd ~
$ mkdir go-zero-demo&&cd go-zero-demo
$ go mod init go-zero-demo
```
