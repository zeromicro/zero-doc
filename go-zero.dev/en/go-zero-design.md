For the design of the microservice framework, we expect that while ensuring the stability of microservices, we must also pay special attention to research and development efficiency. So at the beginning of the design, we have the following guidelines:

* Keep it simple, first principle
* Flexible design, fault-oriented programming
* Tools are bigger than conventions and documents
* High availability
* High concurrency
* Easy to expand
* Friendly to business development, package complexity
* There is only one way to constrain one thing
